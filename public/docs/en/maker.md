# Game Creation

The **Maker** page is where your journey begins. Configure and generate a new game from scratch.

- **Enter a Theme:** This is the most important setting. The AI will use this theme (e.g., "Ancient Rome", "Baking Cookies") to generate relevant words and hints for your puzzle.
- **Game Settings:** You can control the number of levels, words per level, time limit, and grid size.
- **Generate Game:** Click this button to have the AI create your puzzle. After generation, you'll see a summary.
- **Share & Download:** Once a game is generated, you can share it with friends via a unique link or download its data as a file.
- **Start Playing:** To play the game you just created, navigate to the **Player** page using the sidebar. Your new game will appear at the top of the "Available Games" list.
