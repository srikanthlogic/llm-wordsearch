# Playing the Game

The **Player** page is your hub for all games. Here you can play saved games and view your history.

## Tabs

- **Available Games:** This tab lists all the games you've created or loaded from a link. For each game, you have several options:
    - **Play:** Click the play icon to start the game immediately.
    - **Download PDF:** Click the download icon to generate a printable PDF worksheet. Each level gets two pages: one with the puzzle and clues, and a second with the answer key. This is perfect for offline play.
    - **Share:** Click the share icon to copy a unique link to your clipboard. Anyone with the link can add the game to their library.
    - **Delete:** Click the trash icon to permanently remove the game.

- **Game History:** This tab shows the results of every game you've completed, including whether you won or lost, how many levels you finished, and the date you played.

## Gameplay

When you start a game, the view will switch to the game board. Your goal is to find all the hidden words before the timer runs out. Click and drag your mouse to select words. If the timer runs out, the game will end and all correct answers will be revealed on the grid.
